Think about MHPC applications
1. QP as a low-level WB controller
2. Add a pseudo value function (e.g., LQR for roll) to the QP cost function
3. Compare MHPC controller with convec MPC controller (e.g. disturbance rejection, accelerating to desired speed)
4. Leave around one month (hardware MHPC) for SMT paper
